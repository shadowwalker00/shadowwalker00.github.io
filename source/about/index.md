## About
Iâ€™m Guanghao (Steven) Chen. I graduated from **UC San Diego** as a Computer Science Master student in March 2020. I am joining **Amazon Web Service team** as a Software Development Engineer at the end of April 2020. Besides, in my spare time, I like watching NBA games, playing vedio games and taking pictures. Recently, I'm learning how to edit videos and I hope that in the future I could use the camera to record all the interesting experiences in my life. 

## Educations
- M.S. in Computer Science at University of California, San Diego [Sep.2018-Mar.2020]
- B.E. in Computer Science and Technology at Northeastern University, China [Sep.2014-Jun.2018]

## Experiences
- **Software Development Intern@Deepmap, Inc.** [Jun.2019-Sep.2019]
  - Project #1: Deep Learning Training Pipeline based on AWS SageMaker
    - Implemented the infrastructure to run DL training jobs of models for multiple applications
    - Designed and implemented an Airflow pipeline for DL training jobs
    - The pipeline is delivered in production for Automation Team (deep learning team)
  - Project #2: Optimization on Video Format Car Detection
    - Implemented a video format car detector by inferencing frame by frame
    - Built the detector as Http server and deployed as SageMaker Model
    - Implemented a Jenkins pipeline job to parallelly run deal with videos in AWS S3
    - Optimized Jenkins job by implementing the video decoder as child thread and also dealing with multiple S3 paths through multiple processes parallelly to reduce time consumption
    - GPU utilization can reach 99% during running the job for video format data
